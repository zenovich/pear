New features:
    + PHP 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 are now fully supported
    - PHP 4.x is not supported anymore
    + Closures are now accepted by runkit_function_add, runkit_function_redefine, runkit_method_add, and runkit_method_redefine
      This feature works in PHP 5.3 and above.
    + Introduced new function &quot;runkit_default_property_remove&quot; (Thanks to Juhan Kundla)
    + Ability to add non-scalar default properties was added
    + Magic methods __isset, __unset, __callStatic, serialize, unserialize, debugInfo and __toString are now supported.
    + Functions runkit_class_adopt &amp; runkit_class_emancipate now change class-hierarchy (issue #13)
    + Adding and redefining functions and methods, which return references, were fully implemented
      New optional argument 'return_ref' of functions runkit_function_add and runkit_function_redefine was introduced
      New constant RUNKIT_ACC_RETURN_REFERENCE was introduced for use with functions runkit_method_add and runkit_method_redefine
    + Properties adding, removing, and importing were reworked for proper inheritance (including objects in PHP5+)
    + A new constant RUNKIT_OVERRIDE_OBJECTS was introduced. Use it by bitwise adding to the flags parameter
      of functions runkit_default_property_add and runkit_import to add (and remove) properties of existing objects.
      This feature works in PHP 5.x and above and it is switched off by default.
    + New (the third one) parameter remove_from_objects of boolean type was introduced
      in runkit_default_property_remove function. Pass the TRUE value to remove property from existing objects.
      This feature works in PHP 5.x and above. The default value for this parameter is FALSE.
    + Namespaces are fully supported by constants manipulation functions (Thanks to Antony Dovgal)
    + Allow disabling of allow_url_include in a Runkit_Sandbox (PHP &gt;= 5.2) (Thanks to Sara Golemon)
    + New optional argument 'doc_comment' of functions runkit_method_add, runkit_method_redefine, runkit_function_add,
      and runkit_function_redefine was introduced to specify doc_comments.
    + Preserve doc_comments on copying and redefining functions and methods.

Critical fixes:
    * Highly probable crashes on using Reflection objects after modifying removing or renaming of functions, methods, and properties,
      for which those Reflection objects have been instantiated, were eliminated
    * Crash on sandbox creation when register_globals is switched on was fixed
    * Building and working with PHP4 were fixed
    * Crash on syntax error in source file importing with runkit_import was fixed
    * The possible crash on manipulating constants having length less than two characters was eliminated
    * Crash after using runkit_class_adopt when inherited methods access properties of the parent class (issue #59)
    * Crash on calling renamed private/protected method (issue #64)
    * Crash when copied function contains finally (issue #77) (Thanks to Antony Dovgal)
    * Lists of directories in open_basedir sandbox setting are now supported

Fixes:
    * All ways of adding and removing magic methods and old-style constructors
      were reworked and corrected (Thanks to Anthony Dovgal for issues #35, #57, and #79).
    * Side effect of redefining, adding and removing class constant (Issue #25) was eliminated
    * Adding of non-lowercase default properties was fixed (removed lowercasing)
    * Skip the leading slash in class names
    * Copying, redefining, and renaming of functions were reworked
    * Converting of input parameters (class names &amp; function names) to lowecase was eliminated
    * runkit_method_redefine function now sets the 'prototype' field for the method
      and its descendants (Thanks to Anthony Dovgal)
    * Freeing already freed memory on importing of a non-existent file was eliminated
    * A test for correctness of runkit.superglobals feature was added
    * Tests for correctness of inheritance of properties were added
    * Tests for correctness of adding static properties were added
    * Bug 57649 (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=57649) has been fixed without apathy ;)
      Thanks to Sara Golemon for tests.
    * Importing class extending another class was fixed (Issue #48) (thanks to mido0258)
    * User-defined functions should remain after Runkit's shutdown
      (thanks to Sara Golemon for code and to https://github.com/cobrafast for test)
    * Restoring of misplaced internal functions was corrected (issue #63)
    * Delete temporary function on errors of adding/redefining methods
    * runkit_method_add, runkit_method_copy, and runkit_method_rename now override derived methods (issue #62)

Build system improvements:
    * PEAR Channel zenovich.github.io/pear was introduced for releasing new packages
    * Declarations after statement were restricted during compiling
    * Warnings now will be treated as errors
    * All tests now succeed under valgrind
    * A compilation bug (with gcc 4.3+), caused by wrong definition of internal function,
      was fixed (Thanks to Reeze Xia)
