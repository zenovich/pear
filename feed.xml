New features:
    + The patch made by David Sklar was applied to support creation and changing of static methods.
      The new user-level const &quot;RUNKIT_ACC_STATIC&quot; was introduced.
    + An ability to import static class properties was added.
      The new user-level const &quot;RUNKIT_IMPORT_CLASS_STATIC_PROPS&quot; was introduced.
    + An ability to apply a closure to a sandbox in PHP 5.3+ by calling the call_user_func method was added.

Main bug-fixes:
    * Fixes of issues with importing constant arrays into properties and constants
    * Fixes of issues with importing functions or methods having static variables inside them
    * The behaviour that old methods had been always overridden by new ones independently from
      the RUNKIT_IMPORT_OVERRIDE flag was corrected
    * Compatibility with 5.3+ in zts mode
    * runkit_function_* functions were fixed with the patch from Keisial at gmail dot com
      (see the second comment from http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=14086)
    * The reverting of protected methods via runkit_method_copy was corrected, the segmentation fault
      on calling restored method was eliminated
    * Elimination of the segmentation-fault on exit after restoring modified internal functions
      (see also http://pecl.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=11632)
    * Correction for the situation when a method or function having static variables in itself
      and copied by runkit crashes afterwards on calling if the original method or function was removed
    * The issue that the runkit used to create new methods with lowercase names was fixed, tests were extended
    * Methods' prototype detection was fixed
